# EmpSim - Employment Simulation
_An entry for Web Programming contest._

Hello, I'm Marc, a first year student from BSCpE that wants to explore more on websites.

## Concept
I created the concept of this website to be a simulation because of the event description to determine the employment status of graduated students. With this description, I want this website to be dynamic everytime the user runs it. So, I thought of making it a simulation.

## Simulation
The simulation consist of:
### City
A city is the place where all of the Person (graduated students) generated wanders around to find a job.
### Person
The Person has different attributes or properties used to have variations of skills.

### Buildings
